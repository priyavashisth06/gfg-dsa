Buildings with Sunlight
Difficulty: Easy    Accuracy: 40.46%    Submissions: 113K+    Points: 2

Given the array arr[] of heights of certain buildings that lie adjacent to each other, Sunlight starts falling from the left side of the buildings. If there is a building of a certain height, all the buildings to the right side of it having lesser heights cannot see the sun. Find the total number of buildings that receive sunlight.

Note: Buildings with equal height do not block each other and can also receive sunlight.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = [6, 2, 8, 4, 11, 13]
Output: 4
Explanation: Only the buildings with heights 6, 8, 11, and 13 receive sunlight; therefore, the output is 4.

Example 2:
Input: arr[] = [2, 5, 1, 8, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Only buildings of height 2, 5 and 8 can see the sun, hence output is 3.

Example 3:
Input: arr[] = [3, 3, 3, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first three buildings (height 3) receive sunlight, while the last building (1) is blocked. Hence, the output is 3.
