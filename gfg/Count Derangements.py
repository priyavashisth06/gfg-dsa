Count Derangements
Difficulty: Medium    Accuracy: 34.57%    Submissions: 34K+    Points: 4
Given a number n, find the total number of Derangements of elements from 1 to n. A Derangement is a permutation of n elements, such that no element appears in its original position, i.e., 1 should not be the first element, 2 should not be second, etc. For example, [5, 3, 2, 1, 4] is a Derangement of first 5 elements.

Note: The answer will always fit into a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: For [1, 2], there is only one possible derangement: [2, 1].


Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: For the set [1, 2, 3], there are only two possible derangements: [2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2].


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 12

class Solution:
    def derangeCount(self, n: int) -> int:
        a, b = 0, 1
        if n == 1: return 0
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            a, b = b, (i - 1) * (a + b)
        return b
