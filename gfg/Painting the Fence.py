Given a fence with n posts and k colours, find out the number of ways of painting the fence so that not more than two consecutive posts have the same colours.
Answers are guaranteed to be fit into a 32 bit integer.


Examples 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2 
Output: 6
Explanation: Let the 2 colours be 'R' and 'B'. We have following possible combinations:
1. RRB
2. RBR
3. RBB
4. BRR
5. BRB
6. BBR


Example 2:
Input: n = 2, k = 4 
Output: 16
Explanation: After coloring first post with 4 possible combinations, you can still color next posts with all 4 colors. Total possible combinations will be 4x4=16

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 300
1 ≤ k ≤ 105

class Solution:
    def countWays(self, n, k):
        if n == 1: return k
        same, diff = 0, k
        for _ in range(2, n+1):
            same, diff = diff, (same + diff) * (k - 1)
        return same + diff
