Flip to Maximize 1s
Difficulty: Medium    Accuracy: 23.15%    Submissions: 73K+    Points: 4

Given an array arr[] consisting of 0's and 1's. A flip operation involves changing all 0's to 1's and all 1's to 0's within a contiguous subarray. Formally, select a range (l, r) in the array arr[], such that (0 ≤ l ≤ r < n) holds and flip the elements in this range.

Return the maximum number of 1's you can get in the array after doing at most 1 flip operation.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Output: 4
Explanation: By flipping the subarray from index 1 to 2, the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This results in a total of 4 ones, which is the maximum possible after at most one flip.


Example 2:
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: By flipping the subarray from index 1 to 5, the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This results in a total of 6 ones, which is the maximum possible after at most one flip.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1

class Solution:
    def maxOnes(self, arr):
        ones = sum(arr)
        cur = best = 0
        for x in arr:
            cur = max(0, cur + (1 if x == 0 else -1))
            best = max(best, cur)
        return ones + best
