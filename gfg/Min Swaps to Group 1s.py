'''Min Swaps to Group 1s:-- 

You are given a binary array arr[] consisting only of 0s and 1s. Determine the minimum number of swaps required to group all the 1s together in a contiguous subarray.

A swap operation allows you to choose any two indices i and j and exchange their values (i.e., swap(arr[i], arr[j])).

If the array contains no 1s, return -1.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Only 1 swap is required to group all 1's together. Swapping index 1 and 4 will give arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1] 
Output: 1
Explanation: Only 1 swap is required to group all 1's together. Swapping index 0 and 3 will give arr[] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 0]
Output: -1
Explanation: No 1s are present in the array, so return -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1'''
