Difficulty: Easy    Accuracy: 53.02%    Submissions: 15K+    Points: 2
Given an array arr[] of integers, count the number of subarrays in arr[] which are strictly increasing with size greater or equal to 2. A subarray is a contiguous part of array. A subarray is strictly increasing if each element is greater then it's previous element if it exists.



Example 1:
Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 5, 3, 7, 9]
Output: 6
Explanation: The strictly increasing subarrays are: [1, 4], [1, 4, 5], [4, 5], [3, 7], [3, 7, 9], [7, 9]



Example 2:
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Increasing Subarrays of size greater or equal to 2 are : {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {2, 3, 5}, {3, 5}. So answer for this test case is 4.



Example 3:
Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 0
Explanation: No strictly increasing subarray exists.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

class Solution:
    def countIncreasing(self, arr):
        c = ans = 0
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[i-1]:
                c += 1
                ans += c
            else:
                c = 0
        return ans
