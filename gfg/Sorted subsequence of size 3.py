Sorted subsequence of size 3
Difficulty: Medium    Accuracy: 25.95%    Submissions: 90K+    Points: 4    Average Time: 20m

Given an array arr[], find any subsequence of three elements such that, arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] and (i < j < k).

If such a subsequence exists, return the three elements as an array. Otherwise, return an empty array.

Note:
• The driver code will print 1 if the returned subsequence is valid and present in the array.
• The driver code will print 0 if no such subsequence exists.
• If the returned subsequence does not satisfy the required format or conditions, the output will be -1.



Example 1:
Input: arr[] = [12, 11, 10, 5, 6, 2, 30]
Output: 1
Explanation: As 5 < 6 < 30, and they  appear in the same sequence in the array. So output is 1.



Example 2:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1 
Explanation: As the array is sorted, for every i, j, k, where i < j < k, arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k].So output is 1.



Example 3:
Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No such Subsequence exist, so empty array is returned (the driver code automatically prints 0 in this case).
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
