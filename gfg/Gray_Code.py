'''Gray Code
Difficulty:Medium   Accuracy:60.49%   Submissions:15K+     Points: 4


Given a number n, generate bit patterns from 0 to 2n-1 such that successive patterns differ by one bit. 
A Gray code sequence must begin with 0.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: ["00", "01", "11", "10"]
Explanation: 
00 and 01 differ by one bit.
01 and 11 differ by one bit.
11 and 10 also differ by one bit.


Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["000", "001", "011", "010", "110", "111", "101", "100"]
Explanation:
000 and 001 differ by one bit.
001 and 011 differ by one bit.
011 and 010 differ by one bit.
Similarly, every successive pattern 
differs by one bit.
