You are at the side of a river. You are given a m litre jug and a n litre jug . Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs dont have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d litres of water . Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d litres of water in one of the jugs.

The operations you can perform are:
1. Empty a Jug
2. Fill a Jug
3. Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.


Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 5, d = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: Operations are as follow-
1. Fill up the 5 litre jug.
2. Then fill up the 3 litre jug using 5 litre jug. Now 5 litre jug contains 2 litre water.
3. Empty the 3 litre jug.
4. Now pour the 2 litre of water from 5 litre jug to 3 litre jug.
5. Now 3 litre jug contains 2 litre of water and 5 litre jug is empty.
  Now fill up the 5 litre jug.
6. Now fill one litre of water from 5 litre jug to 3 litre jug. Now we have 4 litre water in 5 litre jug.


Example 2:
Input: m = 8, n = 56, d = 46
Output: -1
Explanation: Not possible to fill any one of the jug with 46 litre of water.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 106
1 ≤ d ≤ 106
